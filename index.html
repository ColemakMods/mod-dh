<h3><a name="welcome-to-mod-dh" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-mod-dh">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Colemak Mod-DH</h3>

<p>Colemak Mod-DH is a minor modification to the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> keyboard layout, designed to make typing more comfortable. It is commonly known also as <i>‘Colemak-DH’</i>.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="gfx/mod_dh_main.png"/><br/>
Colemak Mod-DH main keys, shown for an ISO keyboard. Keys are colored according to the finger that should be used. The 10 most common English letters are assigned to the 10 easiest keys (highlighted in red).
</p>

<p>Colemak is a great layout, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to improve on! The idea behind Mod&#8209DH is that by making an adjustment to the placement of a small number of keys, it is possible to gain a significant improvement in ergonomics and comfort. See this <a href="./compare.html">comparison of Mod-DH</a> with other layouts.</p>

<p>There are separate <a href="./keyboards.html">implementations</a> optimized for ISO, ANSI and matrix keyboards.</p>

<b>Highlights:</b>
<ul>
<li>Places the heavily used D and H keys in more comfortable and easier-to-reach positions.</li>
<li>Moves G to a slightly easier position also, reverting to its placement in Qwerty.</li>
<li>Reduces usage of the difficult-to-reach center column by about half.</li>
<li>Retains Colemak's many other strengths, such as its home key placement and low rate of same-finger bigrams.</li>
<li>No keys change fingers from standard Colemak, making it easy to adopt for existing Colemak users.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Colemak forum has threads containing some <a href="http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1939">background information</a> to the creation of this mod, and also a <a href="http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1942">more detailed discussion of it.</a></p>

<h3><a name="colemak-changes" class="anchor" href="#colemak-changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes From Colemak</h3>

<p>The mod consists of two parts, the left-hand "D" change, and the right-hand "H" change.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="gfx/mod_dh_change_colemak.png"/><br/>
Changed keys relative to standard Colemak. Note that none of the changes move keys to a new finger. This makes the mod easy to learn and also retains Colemak's excellent <a href="./compare.html#compare-results">stats</a> on same-finger bigrams.
</p>

<h4><a name="left-hand-changes" class="anchor" href="#left-hand-changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Left Hand Changes</h4>

<p>The primary change is to the left hand:<br/>
1. The "Angle Mod" (<a href="#angle-mod">see below</a>) is applied to keys Z, X, C. This moves them one space to the left but retaining the conventional finger.<br/>
2. Three keys are relocated: D, G, B. This makes the D key much easier to type, using your index finger. The position of G is also improves, and reverts to its Qwerty placement. The B key moves from the hard-to-reach position at the bottom-middle to the new location on the top row.<br/>
</p>

<h4><a name="right-hand-changes" class="anchor" href="#right-hand-changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Right Hand Changes</h4>

<p>There is a minor change to the right hand:<br/>
The H, M and K keys move. This makes H (the most frequent character of the three) easier to type. Since HE is the second most common bigram in English, it also makes it much more comfortable to type very common words such as "the", "then", "where", etc. The M key moves one space to the left, taking the next-best available spot.
</p>

<h3><a name="qwerty-changes" class="anchor" href="#qwerty-changes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes From Qwerty</h3>

<p class="caption"><img src="gfx/mod_dh_change_qwerty.png"/><br/>
Changed keys relative to Qwerty. In total, 19 keys are changed, plus the application of the Angle Mod to an additional 3. Of these, only 12 keys change fingers, same as Colemak.
</p>

<p>If you are currently using Qwerty and looking for a better layout, then both standard Colemak and Mod-DH are excellent choices. The change from Qwerty is not easy and can take some time, but is worthwhile in the end. If you start with Colemak but find the frequent reaching for D, H and G unsatisfactory, or find the common HE bigram uncomfortable, then Mod-DH is for you!
</p>

<h3><a name="angle-mod" class="anchor" href="#angle-mod"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Angle Mod</h3>

The "Angle Mod" makes it possible to adopt a more comfortable typing posture by introducing a degree of symmetry on a standard, staggered keyboard. The keys along the bottom-left are moved one space to the left, but you should type these keys with the conventional finger, Z=pinky, X=ring, C=middle, V=index. This mod is used by many existing Colemak users.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="gfx/angle_mod.png"/></p>

<p>For more information, see this <a href="http://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html">Guide to the Angle Mod.</a></p> 

<p>The Angle Mod is a good innovation, but in its default application it assigns the rare V to one of best locations on the keyboard. Mod-DH fixes this by assigning D to that key instead. An important feature of Mod-DH is that on standard keyboards, use of the Angle Mod idea is intrinsic to the layout design.</p>
<h3><a name="colemak-problems" class="anchor" href="#colemak-problems"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's wrong with standard Colemak anyway?</h3>

<p>For many people, nothing! But others who have tried Colemak have identified flaws, and have found the transition from Qwerty frustrating as a result. Some have even <a href="https://viralintrospection.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/a-different-philosophy-in-designing-keyboard-layouts/#problem">given up on Colemak</a> and looked to other layouts instead. I believe that those who experience problems with Colemak need not give up on it. Mod-DH was created to fix the most common complaints, and to give a more comfortable Colemak experience for those who want it.
</p>

<p>The most commonly identified flaw is Colemak's placement of the D and H keys. As the 8th and 10th most common letters in English, they should ideally be in easy-to-reach positions. Colemak places them on the centre column, which means a lateral motion of the hand is required to access them. If you try this motion frequently, you'll probably find it is somewhat less comfortable than simply moving the index finger down, to where Mod-DH places those keys. The H-E combination is often cited as a common English bigram that is unduly awkward with Colemak. If you think it's easier for the index finger to reach down one key to the bottom row than to the centre column, then you'll find Mod-DH more comfortable to use.
</p>

<caption>Usage of the centre-column keys for standard Colemak and Mod-DH</caption>
</table>

<p>My own experience is that I used standard Colemak for several months, but was unsatisfied with the frequent reaching for the middle of the keyboard to type D and H, and to some extent G. I initially stuck with it, being reluctant to change an established layout and thinking Colemak's other benefits would outweigh its drawbacks. And to be fair, for the most part they do. But I eventually came to realize that in fact there is no need to compromise: By applying Mod-DH, it is possible to retain Colemak's best features, while placing some common letters in easier to access locations and reducing the need to reach for the centre column. Within a couple of days using the left-hand "D" mod, I found it to be a noticeable, significant improvement over standard Colemak. And when applying the right-hand "H" mod, common English words containing HE (the, then, where…) become almost effortless.</p>

The Colemak D and H keys (indicated by crosses) are moved to the more comfortable positions for the index finger, on the bottom row (indicated with ticks).</p>

<h3><a name="revision" class="anchor" href="#variants"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Revisions</h3>

<p>The original Mod-DH was launched in October 2014. Following feedback from users, a minor revision was been made in May 2017, switching the original M and K key positions. Users of Matrix boards may prefer to retain M on the home row.</p>

<h3><a name="keyboard-types" class="anchor" href="#keyboard-types"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementations for Keyboards</h3>

<p>There are implementations available for ISO, ANSI, and matrix (orthogonal) keyboards, for a variety of operating systems. See the <a href="./keyboards.html">Keyboard Types</a> page for example implementations.</p>
